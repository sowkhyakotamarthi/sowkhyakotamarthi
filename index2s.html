            <h1 class="title"> Life of Rabindranath Tagore</h1>
            <p>A Bengali Brahmin from Calcutta with ancestral gentry roots in Burdwan district[9] and Jessore, 
                </p>Tagore wrote poetry as an eight-year-old.[10] At the age of sixteen, he released his first substantial poems under the pseudonym Bhānusiṃha ("Sun Lion"),
                </p> which were seized upon by literary authorities as long-lost classics.[11] By 1877 he graduated to his first short stories and dramas,
                </p> published under his real name. As a humanist, universalist, internationalist, and ardent critic of nationalism,[12] he denounced the British Raj and advocated independence from Britain.
                 As an exponent of the Bengal Renaissance, he advanced a vast canon that comprised paintings, sketches and doodles, hundreds of texts, and some two thousand songs; 
                 .On 25 March 2004, Tagore's Nobel Prize was stolen from the safety vault of the Visva-Bharati University, along with several other of his belongings. On 7 December 2004,
                 </p> the Swedish Academy decided to present two replicas of Tagore's Nobel Prize, one made of gold and the other made of bronze, 
                 </p>to the Visva-Bharati University.[157] It inspired the fictional film Nobel Chor. In 2016, a baul singer named Pradip Bauri accused of sheltering the thieves was arrested and the prize was returned.
                 Tagore despised rote classroom schooling: in "The Parrot's Training", a bird is caged and force-fed textbook pages—to death.Tagore, visiting Santa Barbara in 1917, conceived a new type of university: 
                 </p>he sought to "make Santiniketan the connecting thread between India and the world [and] a world center for the study of humanity somewhere beyond the limits of nation and geography.
                 </p> The school, which he named Visva-Bharati,[d] had its foundation stone laid on 24 December 1918 and was inaugurated precisely three years later.
                 </p> Tagore employed a brahmacharya system: gurus gave pupils personal guidance—emotional, intellectual, and spiritual. Teaching was often done under trees. He staffed the school, he contributed his Nobel Prize monies,
                  and his duties as steward-mentor at Santiniketan kept him busy: mornings he taught classes; afternoons and evenings he wrote the students' textbooks. He fundraised widely for the school in Europe and the United States between 1919 and 1921.</p></div>
